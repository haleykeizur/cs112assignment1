Part One allows a user to input a number of seconds and then the program converts the number of seconds into how many hours, minutes and seconds it is equivalent to. For example, 4567 seconds is equal to 1 hour, 16 minutes, and 7 seconds. This allows the usuer to make easy transversions without manually using a calculator.

Part two tells a user how much money they would need to deposit now, if they want $10,000 within 10 years and the interest rate is 2.99. This would be beneficial to anyone hoping to make an investment.

Part Three allows a user to enter any amount of money, and it outputs how many ten dollar bills, five dollar bills, one dollar bills, fifty cent pieces, quarters, dimes and pennies that would divide into. This could be useful for anyone involved in investing or banking, or someone who just enjoys shopping and spending money and wants to know the least amount of change/number of bills and coins they can have to purchase something.
